## [3.5.2] - 2023-02-16
### Added
* *Nothing*

### Changed
* [#1696](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1696) Migrated to PHPUnit 10.

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#1698](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1698) Fixed error 500 in `robots.txt`.
* [#1688](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1688) Fixed huge performance degradation on `/tags/stats` endpoint.
* [#1693](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1693) Fixed Shlink thinking database already exists if it finds foreign tables.


## [3.5.1] - 2023-02-04
### Added
* *Nothing*

### Changed
* [#1685](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1685) Changed `loosely` mode to `loose`, as it was a typo. The old one keeps working and maps to the new one, but it's considered deprecated.

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#1682](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1682) Fixed incorrect case-insensitive checks in short URLs when using Microsoft SQL server.
* [#1684](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1684) Fixed entities metadata cache not being cleared at docker container start-up when using redis with replication.


## [3.5.0] - 2023-01-28
### Added
* [#1557](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1557) Added support to dynamically redirect to different long URLs based on the visitor's device type.

  For the moment, only `android`, `ios` and `desktop` can have their own specific long URL, and when the visitor cannot be matched against any of them, the regular long URL will be used.

  In the future, more granular device types could be added if appropriate (iOS tablet, android table, tablet, mobile phone, Linux, Mac, Windows, etc).

  In order to match the visitor's device, the `User-Agent` header is used.

* [#1632](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1632) Added amount of bots, non-bots and total visits to the visits summary endpoint.
* [#1633](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1633) Added amount of bots, non-bots and total visits to the tag stats endpoint.
* [#1653](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1653) Added support for all HTTP methods in short URLs, together with two new redirect status codes, 307 and 308.

  Existing Shlink instances will continue to work the same. However, if you decide to set the redirect status codes as 307 or 308, Shlink will also return a redirect for short URLs even when the request method is different from `GET`.

  The status 308 is equivalent to 301, and 307 is equivalent to 302. The difference is that the spec requires the client to respect the original HTTP method when performing the redirect. With 301 and 302, some old clients might perform a `GET` request during the redirect, regardless the original request method.

* [#1662](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1662) Added support to provide openswoole-specific config options via env vars prefixed with `OPENSWOOLE_`.
* [#1389](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1389) and [#706](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/706) Added support for case-insensitive short URLs.

  In order to achieve this, a new env var/config option has been implemented (`SHORT_URL_MODE`), which allows either `strict` or ~~`loosely`~~ `loose`.

  Default value is `strict`, but if `loose` is provided, then short URLs will be matched in a case-insensitive way, and new short URLs will be generated with short-codes in lowercase only.

### Changed
* *Nothing*

### Deprecated
* [#1676](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1676) Deprecated `GET /short-urls/shorten` endpoint. Use `POST /short-urls` to create short URLs instead.
* [#1678](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1678) Deprecated `validateUrl` option on URL creation/edition.

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#1639](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1639) Fixed 500 error returned when request body is not valid JSON, instead of a proper descriptive error.


## [3.4.0] - 2022-12-16
### Added
* [#1612](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1612) Allowed to filter short URLs out of lists, when `validUntil` date is in the past or have reached their maximum amount of visits.

  This can be done by:

  * Providing `excludeMaxVisitsReached=true` and/or `excludePastValidUntil=true` to the `GET /short-urls` endpoint.
  * Providing `--exclude-max-visits-reached` and/or `--exclude-past-valid-until` to the `short-urls:list` command.

* [#1613](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1613) Added amount of visits coming from bots, non-bots and total to every short URL in the short URLs list.

  Additionally, added option to order by non-bot visits, by passing `nonBotVisits-DESC` or `nonBotVisits-ASC`.

* [#1599](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1599) Added support for credentials on redis DSNs, either only password, or both username and password.
* [#1616](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1616) Added support to import orphan visits when importing short URLs from another Shlink instance.
* [#1519](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1519) Allowing to search short URLs by default domain.
* [#1555](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1555) and [#1625](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1625) Added full support for PHP 8.2, updating the docker image to this version.

### Changed
* [#1563](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1563) Moved logic to reuse command options to option classes instead of base abstract command classes.
* [#1569](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1569) Migrated test doubles from phpspec/prophecy to PHPUnit mocks.
* [#1329](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1329) Split some logic from `VisitRepository` and `ShortUrlRepository` into separated repository classes.

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#1618](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1618) Fixed imported short URLs and visits dates not being set to the target server timezone.
* [#1578](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1578) Fixed short URL allowing an empty string as the domain during creation.
* [#1580](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1580) Fixed `FLUSHDB` being run on Shlink docker start-up when using redis, causing full cache to be flushed.

* *Nothing*

### Changed
* [#1474](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1474) Added preliminary support for PHP 8.2 during CI workflow.
* [#1551](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1551) Moved services related to geolocating visits to the `Visit\Geolocation` namespace.

## [3.3.0] - 2022-09-18
### Added
* [#1221](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1221) Added experimental support to run Shlink with [RoadRunner](https://roadrunner.dev) instead of openswoole.
* [#1531](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1531) and [#1090](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1090) Added support for trailing slashes in short URLs.
* [#1406](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1406) Added new REST API version 3.

  When making requests to the REST API with `/rest/v3/...` and an error occurs, all error types will be different, with the next correlation:

  * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` -> `https://shlink.io/api/error/invalid-data`
  * `INVALID_SHORT_URL_DELETION` -> `https://shlink.io/api/error/invalid-short-url-deletion`
  * `DOMAIN_NOT_FOUND` -> `https://shlink.io/api/error/domain-not-found`
  * `FORBIDDEN_OPERATION` -> `https://shlink.io/api/error/forbidden-tag-operation`
  * `INVALID_URL` -> `https://shlink.io/api/error/invalid-url`
  * `INVALID_SLUG` -> `https://shlink.io/api/error/non-unique-slug`
  * `INVALID_SHORTCODE` -> `https://shlink.io/api/error/short-url-not-found`
  * `TAG_CONFLICT` -> `https://shlink.io/api/error/tag-conflict`
  * `TAG_NOT_FOUND` -> `https://shlink.io/api/error/tag-not-found`
  * `MERCURE_NOT_CONFIGURED` -> `https://shlink.io/api/error/mercure-not-configured`
  * `INVALID_AUTHORIZATION` -> `https://shlink.io/api/error/missing-authentication`
  * `INVALID_API_KEY` -> `https://shlink.io/api/error/invalid-api-key`

  If you make a request to the API with v2 or v1, the old error types will be returned, until Shlink 4 is released, when only the new ones will be used.

  Non-error responses are not affected.

* [#1513](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1513) Added publishing of the docker image in GHCR.
* [#1114](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1114) Added support to provide an initial API key via `INITIAL_API_KEY` env var, when running Shlink with openswoole or RoadRunner.

  Also, the installer tool now allows to generate an initial API key that can be copy-pasted (this tool is run interactively), in case you use php-fpm or you don't want to use env vars.

* [#1528](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1528) Added support to delay when the GeoLite2 DB file is downloaded in docker images, speeding up its startup time.

  In order to do it, pass `SKIP_INITIAL_GEOLITE_DOWNLOAD=true` when creating the container.

### Changed
* [#1339](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1339) Added new test suite for CLI E2E tests.
* [#1503](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1503) Drastically improved build time in GitHub Actions, by optimizing parallelization and adding php extensions cache.
* [#1525](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1525) Migrated to custom doctrine CLI entry point.
* [#1492](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1492) Migrated to immutable options objects, mapped with [cuyz/valinor](https://github.com/CuyZ/Valinor).

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#1499](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1499) Fixed loading of config options as env vars, which was making all default configurations to be loaded unless env vars were explicitly provided.


## [3.2.0] - 2022-08-05
### Added
* [#854](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/854) Added support for multi-segment custom slugs.

  The feature is disabled by default, but you can optionally opt in. If you do, you will be able to create short URLs with multiple segments in the custom slug, like `https://example.com/foo/bar/baz`.

* [#1280](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1280) Added missing visit-related commands.

  Now you can run `tag:visits`, `domain:visits`, `visit:orphan` or `visit:non-orphan` to get the corresponding list of visits from the command line.

* [#962](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/962) Added new real-time update for new short URLs.

  You can now subscribe to the `https://shlink.io/new-short-url` topic on any of the supported async updates technologies in order to get notified when a short URL is created.

* [#1367](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1367) Added support to publish real-time updates in redis pub/sub.

  The publishing will happen in the same redis instance/cluster configured for caching.

### Changed
* [#1452](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1452) Updated to monolog 3
* [#1485](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1485) Changed payload published in RabbitMQ for all visits events, in order to conform with the Async API spec.

  Since this is a breaking change, also provided a new `RABBITMQ_LEGACY_VISITS_PUBLISHING=true` env var that can be provided in order to keep the old payload.

  This env var is considered deprecated and will be removed in Shlink 4, when the legacy format will no longer be supported.

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* [#1280](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1280) Dropped support for PHP 8.0

### Fixed

## [3.1.0] - 2022-04-23
### Added
* [#1294](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1294) Allowed to provide a specific domain when importing URLs from YOURLS.
* [#1416](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1416) Added support to import URLs from Kutt.it.
* [#1418](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1418) Added support to customize the timezone used by Shlink, falling back to the default one set in PHP config.

  The timezone can be set via the `TIMEZONE` env var, or using the installer tool.

* [#1309](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1309) Improved URL importing, ensuring individual errors do not make the whole process fail, and instead, failing URLs are skipped.
* [#1162](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1162) Added new endpoint to get visits by domain.

  The endpoint is `GET /domains/{domain}/visits`, and it has the same capabilities as any other visits endpoint, allowing pagination and filtering.

### Changed
* [#1359](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1359) Hidden database commands.
* [#1385](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1385) Prevented a big error message from being logged when using Shlink without mercure.
* [#1398](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1398) Increased required mutation score for unit tests to 85%.

### Deprecated
* [#1340](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1340) Deprecated webhooks. New events will only be added to other real-time updates approaches, and webhooks will be completely removed in Shlink 4.0.0.

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#1397](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1397) Fixed `db:create` command always reporting the schema exists if the `db:migrate` command has been run before by mistake.
* [#1402](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1402) Fixed the base path getting appended with the default domain by mistake, causing multiple side effects in several places.


## [3.0.3] - 2022-02-19
### Added
* *Nothing*

### Changed
* [#1382](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1382) Updated docker image to PHP 8.1.3.

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#1377](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1377) Fixed installer always setting delete threshold with value 1.
* [#1379](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1379) Ensured API keys cannot be created with a domain-only role linked to default domain.


## [3.0.2] - 2022-02-10
### Added
* *Nothing*

### Changed
* *Nothing*

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#1373](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1373) Fixed incorrect config import when updating from Shlink 2.x using SQLite.
* [#1369](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1369) Fixed slow regexps in `.htaccess` file.


## [3.0.1] - 2022-02-04

* *Nothing*

### Changed
* *Nothing*

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#1363](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1363) Fixed titles being resolved no matter what when `validateUrl` is not set or is explicitly set to true.
* [#1352](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1352) Updated to stable pdo_sqlsrv in docker image.


## [3.0.0] - 2022-01-28
### Added
* [#767](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/767) Added full support to use emojis everywhere, whether it is custom slugs, titles, referrers, etc.
* [#1274](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1274) Added support to filter short URLs lists by all provided tags.

  The `GET /short-urls` endpoint now accepts a `tagsMode=all` param which will make only short URLs matching **all** the tags in the `tags[]` query param, to be returned.

  The `short-urls:list` command now accepts a `-i`/`--including-all-tags` flag which behaves the same.

* [#1273](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1273) Added support for pagination in tags lists, allowing to improve performance by loading subsets of tags.

  For backwards compatibility, lists continue returning all items by default, but the `GET /tags` endpoint now supports `page` and `itemsPerPage` query params, to make sure only a subset of the tags is returned.

  This is supported both when invoking the endpoint with and without `withStats=true` query param.

  Additionally, the endpoint also supports filtering by `searchTerm` query param. When provided, only tags matching it will be returned.

* [#1063](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1063) Added new endpoint that allows fetching all existing non-orphan visits, in case you need a global view of all visits received by your Shlink instance.

  This can be achieved using the `GET /visits/non-orphan` endpoint.

### Changed
* [#1277](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1277) Reduced docker image size to 45% of the original size.
* [#1268](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1268) Updated dependencies, including symfony/console 6 and mezzio/mezzio-swoole 4.
* [#1283](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1283) Changed behavior of `DELETE_SHORT_URL_THRESHOLD` env var, disabling the feature if a value was not provided.
* [#1300](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1300) Changed default ordering for short URLs list, returning always from newest to oldest.
* [#1299](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1299) Updated to the latest base docker images, based in PHP 8.1.1, and bumped openswoole to v4.9.1.
* [#1282](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1282) Env vars now have precedence over installer options.
* [#1328](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1328) Refactored ShortUrlsRepository to use DTOs in methods with too many arguments.

### Deprecated
* [#1315](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1315) Deprecated `GET /tags?withStats=true` endpoint. Use `GET /tags/stats` instead.

### Removed
* [#1275](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1275) Removed everything that was deprecated in Shlink 2.x.

  See [UPGRADE](UPGRADE.md#from-v2x-to-v3x) doc in order to get details on how to migrate to this version.

* [#1347](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1347) Dropped support for regular swoole in favor of openswoole.

  Since openswoole support was introduced in the previous release version, Shlink will still consider the swoole extension as openswoole, as at the moment, functionality hasn't deviated too much, and will simplify migrating to Shlink 3.0.0

  However, there's no longer active testing with regular swoole, and it is considered no longer supported. If some incompatibility arises, the only supported solution will be to migrate to openswoole.

### Fixed
* *Nothing*

## [2.10.0] - 2021-12-12
### Added
* [#1163](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1163) Allowed setting not-found redirects for default domain in the same way it's done for any other domain.

    This implies a few non-breaking changes:

    * The domains list no longer has the values of `INVALID_SHORT_URL_REDIRECT_TO`, `REGULAR_404_REDIRECT_TO` and `BASE_URL_REDIRECT_TO` on the default domain redirects.
    * The `GET /domains` endpoint includes a new `defaultRedirects` property in the response, with the default redirects set via config or env vars.
    * The `INVALID_SHORT_URL_REDIRECT_TO`, `REGULAR_404_REDIRECT_TO` and `BASE_URL_REDIRECT_TO` env vars are now deprecated, and should be replaced by `DEFAULT_INVALID_SHORT_URL_REDIRECT`, `DEFAULT_REGULAR_404_REDIRECT` and `DEFAULT_BASE_URL_REDIRECT` respectively. Deprecated ones will continue to work until v3.0.0, where they will be removed.

* [#868](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/868) Added support to publish real-time updates in a RabbitMQ server.

    Shlink will create new exchanges and queues for every topic documented in the [Async API spec](https://api-spec.shlink.io/async-api/), meaning, you will have one queue for orphan visits, one for regular visits, and one queue for every short URL with its visits.

    The RabbitMQ server config can be provided via installer config options, or via environment variables.

* [#1204](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1204) Added support for `openswoole` and migrated official docker image to `openswoole`.
* [#1242](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1242) Added support to import urls and visits from YOURLS.

    In order to do it, you need to first install this [dedicated plugin](https://slnk.to/yourls-import) in YOURLS, and then run the `short-url:import yourls` command, as with any other source.

* [#1235](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1235) Added support to disable rounding QR codes block sizing via config option, env var or query param.
* [#1188](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1188) Added support for PHP 8.1.

    The official docker image has also been updated to use PHP 8.1 by default.

### Changed
* [#844](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/844) Added mutation checks to API tests.
* [#1218](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1218) Updated to symfony/mercure 0.6.
* [#1223](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1223) Updated to phpstan 1.0.
* [#1258](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1258) Updated to Symfony 6 components, except symfony/console.
* Added `domain` field to `DeleteShortUrlException` exception.

### Deprecated
* [#1260](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1260) Deprecated `USE_HTTPS` env var that was added in previous release, in favor of the new `IS_HTTPS_ENABLED`.

    The old one proved to be confusing and misleading, making people think it was used to actually enable HTTPS transparently, instead of its actual purpose, which is just telling Shlink it is being served with HTTPS.

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#1206](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1206) Fixed debugging of the docker image, so that it does not run the commands with `-q` when the `SHELL_VERBOSITY` env var has been provided.
* [#1254](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1254) Fixed examples in swagger docs.

* [#1197](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1197) Fixed amount of task workers provided via config option or env var not being validated to ensure enough workers to process all parallel tasks.


## [2.9.1] - 2021-10-11
### Added
* *Nothing*

### Changed
* *Nothing*

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#1201](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1201) Fixed crash when using the new `USE_HTTPS`, as it's boolean raw value was being used instead of resolving "https" or "http".


## [2.9.0] - 2021-10-10
### Added
* [#1015](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1015) Shlink now accepts configuration via env vars even when not using docker.

  The config generated with the installing tool still has precedence over the env vars, so it cannot be combined. Either you use the tool, or use env vars.

* [#1149](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1149) Allowed to set custom defaults for the QR codes.
* [#1112](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1112) Added new option to define if the query string should be forwarded on a per-short URL basis.

  The new `forwardQuery=true|false` param can be provided during short URL creation or edition, via REST API or CLI command, allowing to override the default behavior which makes the query string to always be forwarded.

* [#1105](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1105) Added support to define placeholders on not-found redirects, so that the redirected URL receives the originally visited path and/or domain.

  Currently, `{DOMAIN}` and `{ORIGINAL_PATH}` placeholders are supported, and they can be used both in the redirected URL's path or query.

  When they are used in the query, the values are URL encoded.

* [#1119](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1119) Added support to provide redis sentinel when using redis cache.
* [#1016](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1016) Added new option to send orphan visits to webhooks, via `NOTIFY_ORPHAN_VISITS_TO_WEBHOOKS` env var or installer tool.

  The option is disabled by default, as the payload is backwards incompatible. You will need to adapt your webhooks to treat the `shortUrl` property as optional before enabling this option.

* [#1104](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1104) Added ability to disable tracking based on IP addresses.

  IP addresses can be provided in the form of fixed addresses, CIDR blocks, or wildcard patterns (192.168.*.*).

### Changed
* [#1142](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1142) Replaced `doctrine/cache` package with `symfony/cache`.
* [#1157](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1157) All routes now support CORS, not only rest ones.
* [#1144](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1144) Added experimental builds under PHP 8.1.

### Deprecated
* [#1164](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1164) Deprecated `SHORT_DOMAIN_HOST` and `SHORT_DOMAIN_SCHEMA` env vars. Use `DEFAULT_DOMAIN` and `USE_HTTPS=true|false` instead.

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#1165](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1165) Fixed warning displayed when trying to locate visits and there are none pending.
* [#1172](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/pull/1172) Removed unneeded explicitly defined volumes in docker image.


## [2.8.1] - 2021-08-15

### Fixed
* [#1155](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1155) Fixed numeric query params in long URLs being replaced by `0`.


## [2.8.0] - 2021-08-04
### Added
* [#1089](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1089) Added new `ENABLE_PERIODIC_VISIT_LOCATE` env var to docker image which schedules the `visit:locate` command every hour when provided with value `true`.
* [#1082](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1082) Added support for error correction level on QR codes.

  Now, when calling the `GET /{shorCode}/qr-code` URL, you can pass the `errorCorrection` query param with values `L` for Low, `M` for Medium, `Q` for Quartile or `H` for High.

* [#1080](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1080) Added support to redirect to URLs as soon as the path starts with a valid short code, appending the rest of the path to the redirected long URL.

  With this, if you have the `https://example.com/abc123` short URL redirecting to `https://www.twitter.com`, a visit to `https://example.com/abc123/shlinkio` will take you to `https://www.twitter.com/shlinkio`.

  This behavior needs to be actively opted in, via installer config options or env vars.

* [#943](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/943) Added support to define different "not-found" redirects for every domain handled by Shlink.

  Shlink will continue to allow defining the default values via env vars or config, but afterwards, you can use the `domain:redirects` command or the `PATCH /domains/redirects` REST endpoint to define specific values for every single domain.

### Changed
* [#1118](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1118) Increased phpstan required level to 8.
* [#1127](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1127) Updated to infection 0.24.
* [#1139](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1139) Updated project dependencies, including base docker image to use PHP 8.0.9 and Alpine 3.14.

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* [#1046](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1046) Dropped support for PHP 7.4.

### Fixed
* [#1098](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1098) Fixed errors when using Redis for caching, caused by some third party lib bug that was fixed on dependencies update.

### Changed
* *Nothing*

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#1100](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1100) Fixed Shlink trying to download GeoLite2 db files even when tracking has been disabled.


## [2.7.0] - 2021-05-23
### Added
* [#1044](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1044) Added ability to set names on API keys, which helps to identify them when the list grows.
* [#819](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/819) Visits are now always located in real time, even when not using swoole.

    The only side effect is that a GeoLite2 db file is now installed when the docker image starts or during shlink installation or update.

    Also, when using swoole, the file is now updated **after** tracking a visit, which means it will not apply until the next one.

* [#1059](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1059) Added ability to optionally display author API key and its name when listing short URLs from the command line.
* [#1066](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1066) Added support to import short URLs and their visits from another Shlink instance using its API.
* [#898](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/898) Improved tracking granularity, allowing to disable visits tracking completely, or just parts of it.

    In order to achieve it, Shlink now supports 4 new tracking-related options, that can be customized via env vars for docker, or via installer:

    * `disable_tracking`: If true, visits will not be tracked at all.
    * `disable_ip_tracking`: If true, visits will be tracked, but neither the IP address, nor the location will be resolved.
    * `disable_referrer_tracking`: If true, the referrer will not be tracked.
    * `disable_ua_tracking`: If true, the user agent will not be tracked.

* [#955](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/955) Added new option to set short URLs as crawlable, making them be listed in the robots.txt as Allowed.
* [#900](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/900) Shlink now tries to detect if the visit is coming from a potential bot or crawler, and allows to exclude those visits from visits lists if desired.

### Changed
* [#1036](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1036) Updated to `happyr/doctrine-specification` 2.0.
* [#1039](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1039) Updated to `endroid/qr-code` 4.0.
* [#1008](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1008) Ensured all logs are sent to the filesystem while running API tests, which helps debugging the reason for tests to fail.

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#1041](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1041) Ensured the default value for the version while building the docker image is `latest`.
* [#1067](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1067) Fixed exception when persisting multiple short URLs in one batch which include the same new tags/domains. This can potentially happen when importing URLs.


## [2.6.2] - 2021-03-12

### Fixed
* [#1047](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1047) Fixed error in migrations when doing a fresh installation using PHP8 and MySQL/Mariadb databases.


## [2.6.1] - 2021-02-22
### Added
* *Nothing*

### Changed
* [#1026](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1026) Removed non-inclusive terms from source code.

### Deprecated

* [#1031](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1031) Fixed shortening of twitter URLs with URL validation enabled.
* [#1034](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1034) Fixed warning displayed when shlink is stopped while running it with swoole.


## [2.6.0] - 2021-02-13
### Added
* [#856](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/856) Added PHP 8.0 support.
* [#941](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/941) Added support to provide a title for every short URL.

    The title can also be automatically resolved from the long URL, when no title was explicitly provided, but this option needs to be opted in.

* [#913](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/913) Added support to import short URLs from a standard CSV file.

    The file requires the `Long URL` and `Short code` columns, and it also accepts the optional `title`, `domain` and `tags` columns.

* [#1000](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1000) Added support to provide a `margin` query param when generating some URL's QR code.
* [#675](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/675) Added ability to track visits to the base URL, invalid short URLs or any other "not found" URL, as known as orphan visits.

    This behavior is enabled by default, but you can opt out via env vars or config options.

    This new orphan visits can be consumed in these ways:

    * The `https://shlink.io/new-orphan-visit` mercure topic, which gets notified when an orphan visit occurs.
    * The `GET /visits/orphan` REST endpoint, which behaves like the short URL visits and tags visits endpoints, but returns only orphan visits.

### Changed
* [#977](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/977) Migrated from `laminas/laminas-paginator` to `pagerfanta/core` to handle pagination.
* [#986](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/986) Updated official docker image to use PHP 8.
* [#1010](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1010) Increased timeout for database commands to 10 minutes.
* [#874](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/874) Changed how dist files are generated. Now there will be two for every supported PHP version, with and without support for swoole.

    The dist files will have been built under the same PHP version they are meant to be run under, ensuring resolved dependencies are the proper ones.

### Deprecated
* [#959](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/959) Deprecated all command flags using camelCase format (like `--expirationDate`), adding kebab-case replacements for all of them (like `--expiration-date`).

    All the existing camelCase flags will continue working for now, but will be removed in Shlink 3.0.0

* [#862](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/862) Deprecated the endpoint to edit tags for a short URL (`PUT /short-urls/{shortCode}/tags`).

    The short URL edition endpoint (`PATCH /short-urls/{shortCode}`) now supports setting the tags too. Use it instead.

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#988](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/988) Fixed serving zero-byte static files in apache and apache-compatible web servers.
* [#990](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/990) Fixed short URLs not properly composed in REST API endpoints when both custom domain and custom base path are used.
* [#1002](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/1002) Fixed weird behavior in which GeoLite2 metadata's `buildEpoch` is parsed as string instead of int.
* [#851](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/851) Fixed error when trying to schedule swoole tasks in ARM architectures (like raspberry).


## [2.5.2] - 2021-01-24
### Added
* [#965](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/965) Added docs section for Architectural Decision Records, including the one for API key roles.

### Changed

### Fixed
* [#979](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/979) Added missing `itemsPerPage` query param to swagger docs for short URLs list.
* [#980](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/980) Fixed value used for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, that could not work as expected when including an IP address.
* [#947](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/947) Fixed incorrect value returned in `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header, which always contained all methods.


## [2.5.1] - 2021-01-21
### Added
* *Nothing*

### Changed
* *Nothing*

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

* [#972](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/972) Fixed 500 error when calling single-step short URL creation endpoint.


## [2.5.0] - 2021-01-17
### Added
* [#795](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/795) and [#882](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/882) Added new roles system to API keys.

    API keys can have any combinations of these two roles now, allowing to limit their interactions:

    * Can interact only with short URLs created with that API key.
    * Can interact only with short URLs for a specific domain.

* [#833](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/833) Added support to connect through unix socket when using an external MySQL, MariaDB or Postgres database.

    It can be provided during the installation, or as the `DB_UNIX_SOCKET` env var for the docker image.

* [#869](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/869) Added support for Mercure Hub 0.10.
* [#896](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/896) Added support for unicode characters in custom slugs.
* [#930](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/930) Added new `bin/set-option` script that allows changing individual configuration options on existing shlink instances.
* [#877](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/877) Improved API tests on CORS, and "refined" middleware handling it.

### Changed
* [#912](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/912) Changed error templates to be plain html files, removing the dependency on `league/plates` package.
* [#875](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/875) Updated to `mezzio/mezzio-swoole` v3.1.
* [#952](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/952) Simplified in-project docs, by keeping only the basics and linking to the websites docs for anything else.

### Deprecated
* [#917](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/917) Deprecated `/{shortCode}/qr-code/{size}` URL, in favor of providing the size in the query instead, `/{shortCode}/qr-code?size={size}`.
* [#924](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/924) Deprecated mechanism to provide config options to the docker image through volumes. Use the env vars instead as a direct replacement.

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#904](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/904) Explicitly added missing "Domains" and "Integrations" tags to swagger docs.
* [#901](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/901) Ensured domains which are not in use on any short URL are not returned on the list of domains.
* [#899](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/899) Avoided filesystem errors produced while downloading geolite DB files on several shlink instances that share the same filesystem.
* [#827](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/827) Fixed swoole config getting loaded in config cache if a console command is run before any web execution, when swoole extension is enabled, making subsequent non-swoole web requests fail.


## [2.4.1] - 2020-11-10
### Added

* [#867](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/867) Fixed not-found redirects not using proper status (301 or 302) as configured during installation.


## [2.4.0] - 2020-11-08
### Added
* [#829](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/829) Added support for QR codes in SVG format, by passing `?format=svg` to the QR code URL.
* [#820](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/820) Added new option to force enabling or disabling URL validation on a per-URL basis.

    Currently, there's a global config that tells if long URLs should be validated (by ensuring they are publicly accessible and return a 2xx status). However, this is either always applied or never applied.

    Now, it is possible to enforce validation or enforce disabling validation when a new short URL is created or edited:

    * On the `POST /short-url` and `PATCH /short-url/{shortCode}` endpoints, you can now pass `validateUrl: true/false` in order to enforce enabling or disabling validation, ignoring the global config. If the value is not provided, the global config is still normally applied.
    * On the `short-url:generate` CLI command, you can pass `--validate-url` or `--no-validate-url` flags, in order to enforce enabling or disabling validation. If none of them is provided, the global config is still normally applied.

* [#838](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/838) Added new endpoint and CLI command to list existing domains.

    It returns both default domain and specific domains that were used for some short URLs.

    * REST endpoint: `GET /rest/v2/domains`
    * CLI Command: `domain:list`

* [#832](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/832) Added support to customize the port in which the docker image listens by using the `PORT` env var or the `port` config option.

* [#860](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/860) Added support to import links from bit.ly.

    Run the command `short-urls:import bitly` and introduce requested information in order to import all your links.

    Other sources will be supported in future releases.

### Changed
* [#836](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/836) Added support for the `<field>-<dir>` notation while determining how to order the short URLs list, as in `?orderBy=shortCode-DESC`. This effectively deprecates the array notation (`?orderBy[shortCode]=DESC`), that will be removed in Shlink 3.0.0
* [#782](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/782) Added code coverage to API tests.
* [#858](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/858) Updated to latest infection version. Updated docker images to PHP 7.4.11 and swoole 4.5.5
* [#887](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/pull/887) Started tracking the API key used to create short URLs, in order to allow restrictions in future releases.

### Deprecated
* [#883](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/883) Deprecated `POST /tags` endpoint and `tag:create` command, as tags are created automatically while creating short URLs.

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#837](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/837) Drastically improved performance when creating a new shortUrl and providing `findIfExists = true`.
* [#878](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/878) Added missing `gmp` extension to the official docker image.


## [2.3.0] - 2020-08-09
### Added
* [#746](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/746) Allowed to configure the kind of redirect you want to use for your short URLs. You can either set:

    * `302` redirects: Default behavior. Visitors always hit the server.
    * `301` redirects: Better for SEO. Visitors hit the server the first time and then cache the redirect.

    When selecting 301 redirects, you can also configure the time redirects are cached, to mitigate deviations in stats.

* [#734](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/734) Added support to redirect to deeplinks and other links with schemas different from `http` and `https`.
* [#709](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/709) Added multi-architecture builds for the docker image.

* [#707](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/707) Added `--all` flag to `short-urls:list` command, which will print all existing URLs in one go, with no pagination.

    It has one limitation, though. Because of the way the CLI tooling works, all rows in the table must be loaded in memory. If the amount of URLs is too high, the command may fail due to too much memory usage.

### Changed
* [#508](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/508) Added mutation checks to database tests.
* [#790](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/790) Updated to doctrine/migrations v3.

* [#769](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/769) Fixed custom slugs not allowing valid URL characters, like `.`, `_` or `~`.
* [#781](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/781) Fixed memory leak when loading visits for a tag which is used for big amounts of short URLs.


## [2.2.1] - 2020-05-11
### Added
* *Nothing*

### Changed
* *Nothing*

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#764](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/764) Fixed error when trying to match an existing short URL which does not have `validSince` and/or `validUntil`, but you are providing either one of them for the new one.


## [2.2.0] - 2020-05-09
### Added
* [#712](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/712) Added support to integrate Shlink with a [mercure hub](https://mercure.rocks/) server.

    Thanks to that, Shlink will be able to publish events that can be consumed in real time.

    For now, two topics (events) are published, when new visits occur. Both include a payload with the visit and the shortUrl:

        * A visit occurs on any short URL: `https://shlink.io/new-visit`.
        * A visit occurs on short URLs with a specific short code: `https://shlink.io/new-visit/{shortCode}`.

    The updates are only published when serving Shlink with swoole.

    Also, Shlink exposes a new endpoint `GET /rest/v2/mercure-info`, which returns the public URL of the mercure hub, and a valid JWT that can be used to subscribe to updates.

* [#673](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/673) Added new `[GET /visits]` rest endpoint which returns basic visits stats.
* [#674](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/674) Added new `[GET /tags/{tag}/visits]` rest endpoint which returns visits by tag.

    It works in the same way as the `[GET /short-urls/{shortCode}/visits]` one, returning the same response payload, and supporting the same query params, but the response is the list of visits in all short URLs which have provided tag.

* [#672](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/672) Enhanced `[GET /tags]` rest endpoint so that it is possible to get basic stats info for every tag.

    Now, if the `withStats=true` query param is provided, the response payload will include a new `stats` property which is a list with the amount of short URLs and visits for every tag.

    Also, the `tag:list` CLI command has been changed and it always behaves like this.

* [#640](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/640) Allowed to optionally disable visitors' IP address anonymization. This will make Shlink no longer be GDPR-compliant, but it's OK if you only plan to share your URLs in countries without this regulation.

### Changed
* [#692](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/692) Drastically improved performance when loading visits. Specially noticeable when loading big result sets.
* [#657](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/657) Updated how DB tests are run in travis by using docker containers which allow all engines to be covered.
* [#751](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/751) Updated PHP and swoole versions used in docker image, and removed mssql-tools, as they are not needed.

* [#705](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/705) Fixed how the short URL domain is inferred when generating QR codes, making sure the configured domain is respected even if the request is performed using a different one, and only when a custom domain is used, then that one is used instead.


## [2.1.2] - 2020-03-29
### Added

* [#521](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/521) The long URL for any existing short URL can now be edited using the `PATCH /short-urls/{shortCode}` endpoint.

### Changed
* [#656](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/656) Updated to PHPUnit 9.
* [#641](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/641) Added two new flags to the `visit:locate` command, `--retry` and `--all`.

    * When `--retry` is provided, it will try to re-locate visits which IP address was originally considered not found, in case it was a temporal issue.
    * When `--all` is provided together with `--retry`, it will try to re-locate all existing visits. A warning and confirmation are displayed, as this can have side effects.

### Deprecated

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#596](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/596) Fixed error when trying to download GeoLite2 database due to changes on how to get the database files.


## [1.21.0] - 2019-12-29
### Added
* [#118](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/118) API errors now implement the [problem details](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) standard.

    In order to make it backwards compatible, two things have been done:

    * Both the old `error` and `message` properties have been kept on error response, containing the same values as the `type` and `detail` properties respectively.
    * The API `v2` has been enabled. If an error occurs when calling the API with this version, the `error` and `message` properties will not be returned.

    > After Shlink v2 is released, both API versions will behave like API v2.

* [#575](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/575) Added support to filter short URL lists by date ranges.

    * The `GET /short-urls` endpoint now accepts the `startDate` and `endDate` query params.
    * The `short-urls:list` command now allows `--startDate` and `--endDate` flags to be optionally provided.

* [#338](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/338) Added support to asynchronously notify external services via webhook, only when shlink is served with swoole.

    Configured webhooks will receive a POST request every time a URL receives a visit, including information about the short URL and the visit.

    The payload will look like this:

    ```json
    {
      "shortUrl": {},
      "visit": {}
    }
    ```

    > The `shortUrl` and `visit` props have the same shape as it is defined in the [API spec](https://api-spec.shlink.io).

### Changed
* [#492](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/492) Updated to monolog 2, together with other dependencies, like Symfony 5 and infection-php.
* [#527](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/527) Increased minimum required mutation score for unit tests to 80%.

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#561](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/561) Fixed `db:migrate` command failing because yaml extension is not installed, which makes config file not to be readable.
* [#562](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/562) Fixed internal server error being returned when renaming a tag to another tag's name. Now a meaningful API error with status 409 is returned.
* [#555](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/555) Fixed internal server error being returned when invalid dates are provided for new short URLs. Now a 400 is returned, as intended.


## [1.20.1] - 2019-11-17
### Added
* [#519](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/519) Documented how to customize web workers and task workers for the docker image.

* [#540](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/540) Fixed errors thrown when creating short URLs if the original URL has an internationalized domain name and URL validation is enabled.
* [#528](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/528) Ensured `db:create` and `db:migrate` commands do not silently fail when run as part of `install` or `update`.
* [#518](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/518) Fixed service which updates Geolite db file to use a local lock instead of a shared one, since every shlink instance holds its own db instance.


## [1.20.0] - 2019-11-02
### Added
* [#491](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/491) Added improved short code generation logic.

    Now, short codes are truly random, which removes the guessability factor existing in previous versions.

    Generated short codes have 5 characters, and shlink makes sure they keep unique, while making it backwards-compatible.

* [#418](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/418) and [#419](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/419) Added support to redirect any 404 error to a custom URL.

    It was already possible to configure this but only for invalid short URLs. Shlink now also support configuring redirects for the base URL and any other kind of "not found" error.

    The three URLs can be different, and it is already possible to pass them to the docker image via configuration or env vars.

    The installer also asks for these two new configuration options.

* [#497](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/497) Officially added support for MariaDB.

### Changed
* [#458](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/458) Updated coding styles to use [shlinkio/php-coding-standard](https://github.com/shlinkio/php-coding-standard) v2.0.0.

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed

* [#507](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/507) Fixed error with too long original URLs by increasing size to the maximum value (2048) based on [the standard](https://stackoverflow.com/a/417184).
* [#502](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/502) Fixed error when providing the port as part of the domain on short URLs.
* [#509](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/509) Fixed error when trying to generate a QR code for a short URL which uses a custom domain.
* [#522](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/522) Highly mitigated errors thrown when lots of short URLs are created concurrently including new and existing tags.


## [1.19.0] - 2019-10-05
### Added
* [#482](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/482) Added support to serve shlink under a sub path.

    The `router.base_path` config option can be defined now to set the base path from which shlink is served.

    ```php
    return [
        'router' => [
            'base_path' => '/foo/bar',
        ],
    ];
    ```

    This option will also be available on shlink-installer 1.3.0, so the installer will ask for it. It can also be provided for the docker image as the `BASE_PATH` env var.

* [#479](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/479) Added preliminary support for multiple domains.

    Endpoints and commands which create short URLs support providing the `domain` now (via query param or CLI flag). If not provided, the short URLs will still be "attached" to the default domain.

    Custom slugs can be created on multiple domains, allowing to share links like `https://s.test/my-campaign` and `https://example.com/my-campaign`, under the same shlink instance.

    When resolving a short URL to redirect end users, the following rules are applied:

    * If the domain used for the request plus the short code/slug are found, the user is redirected to that long URL and the visit is tracked.
    * If the domain is not known but the short code/slug is defined for default domain, the user is redirected there and the visit is tracked.
    * In any other case, no redirection happens and no visit is tracked (if a fall back redirection is configured for not-found URLs, it will still happen).

### Changed
* [#486](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/486) Updated to [shlink-installer](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink-installer) v2, which supports asking for base path in which shlink is served.

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* [#435](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/435) Removed translations for error pages. All error pages are in english now.

### Fixed
* *Nothing*


## [1.18.1] - 2019-08-24
### Added
* *Nothing*

### Changed
* [#450](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/450) Added PHP 7.4 to the build matrix, as an allowed-to-fail env.
* [#441](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/441) and [#443](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/443) Split some logic into independent modules.
* [#451](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/451) Updated to infection 0.13.
* [#467](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/467) Moved docker image config to main Shlink repo.

### Deprecated
* [#428](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/428) Deprecated preview-generation feature. It will keep working but it will be removed in Shlink v2.0.0

### Removed
* [#468](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/468) Removed APCu extension from docker image.

### Fixed
* [#449](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/449) Fixed error when trying to save too big referrers on PostgreSQL.


## [1.18.0] - 2019-08-08
### Added
* [#411](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/411) Added new `meta` property on the `ShortUrl` REST API model.

    These endpoints are affected and include the new property when suitable:

    * `GET /short-urls` - List short URLs.
    * `GET /short-urls/shorten` - Create a short URL (for integrations).
    * `GET /short-urls/{shortCode}` - Get one short URL.
    * `POST /short-urls` - Create short URL.

    The property includes the values `validSince`, `validUntil` and `maxVisits` in a single object. All of them are nullable.

    ```json
    {
      "validSince": "2016-01-01T00:00:00+02:00",
      "validUntil": null,
      "maxVisits": 100
    }
    ```

* [#285](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/285) Visit location resolution is now done asynchronously but in real time thanks to swoole task management.

    Now, when a short URL is visited, a task is enqueued to locate it. The user is immediately redirected to the long URL, and in the background, the visit is located, making stats to be available a couple of seconds after the visit without the requirement of cronjobs being run constantly.

    Sadly, this feature is not enabled when serving shlink via apache/nginx, where you should still rely on cronjobs.

* [#384](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/384) Improved how remote IP addresses are detected.

    This new set of headers is now also inspected looking for the IP address:

    * CF-Connecting-IP
    * True-Client-IP
    * X-Real-IP

* [#440](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/pull/440) Created `db:create` command, which improves how the shlink database is created, with these benefits:

    * It sets up a lock which prevents the command to be run concurrently.
    * It checks of the database does not exist, and creates it in that case.
    * It checks if the database tables already exist, exiting gracefully in that case.

* [#442](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/pull/442) Created `db:migrate` command, which improves doctrine's migrations command by generating a lock, preventing it to be run concurrently.

### Changed
* [#430](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/430) Updated to [shlinkio/php-coding-standard](https://github.com/shlinkio/php-coding-standard) 1.2.2
* [#305](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/305) Implemented changes which will allow Shlink to be truly clusterizable.
* [#262](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/262) Increased mutation score to 75%.

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#416](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/416) Fixed error thrown when trying to locate visits after the GeoLite2 DB is downloaded for the first time.
* [#424](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/424) Updated wkhtmltoimage to version 0.12.5
* [#427](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/427) and [#434](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/434) Fixed shlink being unusable after a database error on swoole contexts.

* [#377](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/377) Updated `visit:locate` command (formerly `visit:process`) to automatically update the GeoLite2 database if it is too old or it does not exist.

    This simplifies processing visits in a container-based infrastructure, since a fresh container is capable of getting an updated version of the file by itself.

    It also removes the need of asynchronously and programmatically updating the file, which deprecates the `visit:update-db` command.

* [#373](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/373) Added support for a simplified config. Specially useful to use with the docker container.

### Changed
* [#56](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/56) Simplified supported cache, requiring APCu always.

### Deprecated
* [#406](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/406) Deprecated `PUT /short-urls/{shortCode}` REST endpoint in favor of `PATCH /short-urls/{shortCode}`.

### Removed
* [#385](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/385) Dropped support for PHP 7.1
* [#379](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/379) Removed copyright from error templates.

### Fixed
* *Nothing*


## [1.16.3] - 2019-03-30
### Added
* *Nothing*

### Changed
* [#153](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/153) Updated to [doctrine/migrations](https://github.com/doctrine/migrations) version 2.0.0
* [#376](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/376) Allowed `visit:update-db` command to not return an error exit code even if download fails, by passing the `-i` flag.
* [#341](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/341) Improved database tests so that they are executed against all supported database engines.

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#382](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/382) Fixed existing short URLs not properly checked when providing the `findIfExists` flag.


## [1.16.2] - 2019-03-05
### Added
* *Nothing*

### Changed
* *Nothing*

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#368](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/368) Fixed error produced when running a `SELECT COUNT(...)` with `ORDER BY` in PostgreSQL databases.


## [1.16.1] - 2019-02-26
### Added
* *Nothing*

### Changed
* [#363](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/363) Updated to `shlinkio/php-coding-standard` version 1.1.0

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#362](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/362) Fixed all visits without an IP address being processed every time the `visit:process` command is executed.


## [1.16.0] - 2019-02-23
### Added
* [#304](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/304) Added health endpoint to check healthiness of the service. Useful in container-based infrastructures.

    Call [GET /rest/health] in order to get a response like this:

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/health+json
    Content-Length: 681

    {
      "status": "pass",
      "version": "1.16.0",
      "links": {
        "about": "https://shlink.io",
        "project": "https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink"
      }
    }
    ```

    The status code can be `200 OK` in case of success or `503 Service Unavailable` in case of error, while the `status` property will be one of `pass` or `fail`, as defined in the [Health check RFC](https://inadarei.github.io/rfc-healthcheck/).

* [#279](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/279) Added new `findIfExists` flag to the `[POST /short-url]` REST endpoint and the `short-urls:generate` CLI command. It can be used to return existing short URLs when found, instead of creating new ones.

    Thanks to this flag you won't need to remember if you created a short URL for a long one. It will just create it if needed or return the existing one if possible.

    The behavior might be a little bit counterintuitive when combined with other params. This is how the endpoint behaves when providing this new flag:

    * Only the long URL is provided: It will return the newest match or create a new short URL if none is found.
    * Long url and custom slug are provided: It will return the short URL when both params match, return an error when the slug is in use for another long URL, or create a new short URL otherwise.
    * Any of the above but including other params (tags, validSince, validUntil, maxVisits): It will behave the same as the previous two cases, but it will try to exactly match existing results using all the params. If any of them does not match, it will try to create a new short URL.

* [#336](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/336) Added an API test suite which performs API calls to an actual instance of the web service.

### Changed
* [#342](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/342) The installer no longer asks for a charset to be provided, and instead, it shuffles the base62 charset.
* [#320](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/320) Replaced query builder by plain DQL for all queries which do not need to be dynamically generated.
* [#330](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/330) No longer allow failures on PHP 7.3 envs during project CI build.
* [#335](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/335) Renamed functional test suite to database test suite, since that better describes what it actually does.
* [#346](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/346) Extracted installer as an independent tool.
* [#261](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/261) Increased mutation score to 70%.

### Deprecated
* [#351](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/351) Deprecated `config:generate-charset` and `config:generate-secret` CLI commands.

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#317](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/317) Fixed error while trying to generate previews because of global config file being deleted by mistake by build script.
* [#307](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/307) Fixed memory leak while trying to process huge amounts of visits due to the query not being properly paginated.


## [1.15.1] - 2018-12-16
### Added
* [#162](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/162) Added non-rest endpoints to swagger definition.

### Changed
* [#312](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/312) Now all config files both in `php` and `json` format are loaded from `config/params` folder, easing users to provided customizations to docker image.
* [#226](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/226) Updated how table are rendered in CLI commands, making use of new features in Symfony 4.2.
* [#321](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/321) Extracted entities mappings from entities to external config files.
* [#308](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/308) Automated docker image building.

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* [#301](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/301) Removed custom `AccessLogFactory` in favor of the implementation included in [zendframework/zend-expressive-swoole](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-swoole) v2.2.0

### Fixed
* [#309](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/309) Added missing favicon to prevent 404 errors logged when an error page is loaded in a browser.
* [#310](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/310) Fixed execution context not being properly detected, making `CloseDbConnectionMiddleware` to be always piped. Now the check is not even made, which simplifies everything.


## [1.15.0] - 2018-12-02
### Added
* [#208](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/208) Added initial support to run shlink using [swoole](https://www.swoole.co.uk/), a non-blocking IO server which improves the performance of shlink from 4 to 10 times.

    Run shlink with `./vendor/bin/zend-expressive-swoole start` to start-up the service, which will be exposed in port `8080`.

    Adding the `-d` flag, it will be started as a background service. Then you can use the `./vendor/bin/zend-expressive-swoole stop` command in order to stop it.

* [#266](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/266) Added pagination to `GET /short-urls/{shortCode}/visits` endpoint.

    In order to make it backwards compatible, it keeps returning all visits by default, but it now allows to provide the `page` and `itemsPerPage` query parameters in order to configure the number of items to get.

### Changed
* [#267](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/267) API responses and the CLI interface is no longer translated and uses english always. Only not found error templates are still translated.
* [#289](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/289) Extracted coding standard rules to a separated package.
* [#273](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/273) Improved code coverage in repository classes.

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#278](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/pull/278) Added missing `X-Api-Key` header to the list of valid cross domain headers.
* [#295](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/pull/295) Fixed custom slugs so that they are case sensitive and do not try to lowercase provided values.


## [1.14.1] - 2018-11-17
### Added
* *Nothing*

### Changed
* [#260](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/260) Increased mutation score to 65%.

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#271](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/271) Fixed memory leak produced when processing high amounts of visits at the same time.
* [#272](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/272) Fixed errors produced when trying to process visits multiple times in parallel, by using a lock which ensures only one instance is run at a time.


## [1.14.0] - 2018-11-16
### Added
* [#236](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/236) Added option to define a redirection to a custom URL when a user hits an invalid short URL.

    It only affects URLs matched as "short URL" where the short code is invalid, not any 404 that happens in the app. For example, a request to the path `/foo/bar` will keep returning a 404.

    This new option will be asked by the installer both for new shlink installations and for any previous shlink version which is updated.

* [#189](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/189) and [#240](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/240) Added new [GeoLite2](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/)-based geolocation service which is faster and more reliable than previous one.

    It does not have API limit problems, since it uses a local database file.

    Previous service is still used as a fallback in case GeoLite DB does not contain any IP address.

### Changed
* [#241](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/241) Fixed columns in `visit_locations` table, to be snake_case instead of camelCase.
* [#228](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/228) Updated how exceptions are serialized into logs, by using monolog's `PsrLogMessageProcessor`.
* [#225](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/225) Performance and maintainability slightly improved by enforcing via code sniffer that all global namespace classes, functions and constants are explicitly imported.
* [#196](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/196) Reduced anemic model in entities, defining more expressive public APIs instead.
* [#249](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/249) Added [functional-php](https://github.com/lstrojny/functional-php) to ease collections handling.
* [#253](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/253) Increased `user_agent` column length in `visits` table to 512.
* [#256](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/256) Updated to Infection v0.11.
* [#202](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/202) Added missing response examples to OpenAPI docs.

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#223](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/223) Fixed PHPStan errors produced with symfony/console 4.1.5


## [1.13.2] - 2018-10-18
### Added
* [#233](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/233) Added PHP 7.3 to build matrix allowing its failure.

### Changed
* [#235](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/235) Improved update instructions (thanks to [tivyhosting](https://github.com/tivyhosting)).

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#237](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/233) Solved errors when trying to geo-locate `null` IP addresses.

    Also improved how visitor IP addresses are discovered, thanks to [akrabat/ip-address-middleware](https://github.com/akrabat/ip-address-middleware) package.


## [1.13.1] - 2018-10-16
### Added
* *Nothing*

### Changed
* *Nothing*

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#231](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/197) Fixed error when processing visits.


## [1.13.0] - 2018-10-06
### Added
* [#197](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/197) Added [cakephp/chronos](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/chronos.html) library for date manipulations.
* [#214](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/214) Improved build script, which allows builds to be done without "jumping" outside the project directory, and generates smaller dist files.

    It also allows automating the dist file generation in travis-ci builds.

* [#207](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/207) Added two new config options which are asked during installation process. The config options already existed in previous shlink version, but you had to manually set their values.

    These are the new options:

    * Visits threshold to allow short URLs to be deleted.
    * Check the visits threshold when trying to delete a short URL via REST API.

### Changed
* [#211](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/211) Extracted installer to its own module, which will simplify moving it to a separated package in the future.
* [#200](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/200) and [#201](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/201) Renamed REST Action classes and CLI Command classes to use the concept of `ShortUrl` instead of the concept of `ShortCode` when referring to the entity, and left the `short code` concept to the identifier which is used as a unique code for a specific `Short URL`.
* [#181](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/181) When importing the configuration from a previous shlink installation, it no longer asks to import every block. Instead, it is capable of detecting only new config options introduced in the new version, and ask only for those.

    If no new options are found and you have selected to import config, no further questions will be asked and shlink will just import the old config.

### Deprecated
* [#205](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/205) Deprecated `[POST /authenticate]` endpoint, and allowed any API request to be automatically authenticated using the `X-Api-Key` header with a valid API key.

    This effectively deprecates the `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` authentication form, but it will keep working.

* As of [#200](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/200) and [#201](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/201) REST urls have changed from `/short-codes/...` to `/short-urls/...`, and the command namespaces have changed from `short-code:...` to `short-url:...`.

    In both cases, backwards compatibility has been retained and the old ones are aliases for the new ones, but the old ones are considered deprecated.

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#203](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/203) Fixed some warnings thrown while unzipping distributable files.
* [#206](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/206) An error is now thrown during installation if any required param is left empty, making the installer display a message and ask again until a value is set.


## [1.12.0] - 2018-09-15
### Added
* [#187](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/187) Included an API endpoint and a CLI command to delete short URLs.

    Due to the implicit danger of this operation, the deletion includes a safety check. URLs cannot be deleted if they have more than a specific amount of visits.

    The visits threshold is set to **15** by default and currently it has to be manually changed. In future versions the installation/update process will ask you about the value of the visits threshold.

    In order to change it, open the `config/autoload/delete_short_urls.global.php` file, which has this structure:

    ```php
    return [

        'delete_short_urls' => [
            'visits_threshold' => 15,
            'check_visits_threshold' => true,
        ],

    ];
    ```

    Properties are self explanatory. Change `check_visits_threshold` to `false` to completely disable this safety check, and change the value of `visits_threshold` to allow short URLs with a different number of visits to be deleted.

    Once changed, delete the `data/cache/app_config.php` file (if any) to let shlink know about the new values.

    This check is implicit for the API endpoint, but can be "disabled" for the CLI command, which will ask you when trying to delete a URL which has reached to threshold in order to force the deletion.

* [#183](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/183) and [#190](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/190) Included important documentation improvements in the repository itself. You no longer need to go to the website in order to see how to install or use shlink.
* [#186](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/186) Added a small robots.txt file that prevents 404 errors to be logged due to search engines trying to index the domain where shlink is located. Thanks to [@robwent](https://github.com/robwent) for the contribution.

### Changed
* [#145](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/145) Shlink now obfuscates IP addresses from visitors by replacing the latest octet by `0`, which does not affect geolocation and allows it to fulfil the GDPR.

    Other known services follow this same approach, like [Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en) or [Matomo](https://matomo.org/docs/privacy/#step-1-automatically-anonymize-visitor-ips)

* [#182](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/182) The short URL creation API endpoints now return the same model used for lists and details endpoints.

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#188](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/188) Shlink now allows multiple short URLs to be created that resolve to the same long URL.


## [1.11.0] - 2018-08-13
### Added
* [#170](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/170) and [#171](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/171) Updated `[GET /short-codes]` and `[GET /short-codes/{shortCode}]` endpoints to return more meaningful information and make their response consistent.

    The short URLs are now represented by this object in both cases:

    ```json
    {
        "shortCode": "12Kb3",
        "shortUrl": "https://s.test/12Kb3",
        "longUrl": "https://shlink.io",
        "dateCreated": "2016-05-01T20:34:16+02:00",
        "visitsCount": 1029,
        "tags": [
            "shlink"
        ],
        "originalUrl": "https://shlink.io"
    }
    ```

    The `originalUrl` property is considered deprecated and has been kept for backward compatibility purposes. It holds the same value as the `longUrl` property.

### Changed
* *Nothing*

### Deprecated
* The `originalUrl` property in `[GET /short-codes]` and `[GET /short-codes/{shortCode}]` endpoints is now deprecated and replaced by the `longUrl` property.

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* *Nothing*


## [1.10.2] - 2018-08-04
### Added
* *Nothing*

### Changed
* *Nothing*

### Deprecated
* *Nothing*

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#177](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/177) Fixed `[GET] /short-codes` endpoint returning a 500 status code when trying to filter by `tags` and `searchTerm` at the same time.
* [#175](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/175) Fixed error introduced in previous version, where you could end up banned from the service used to resolve IP address locations.

    In order to fix that, just fill [this form](http://ip-api.com/docs/unban) including your server's IP address and your server should be unbanned.
    
    In order to prevent this, after resolving 150 IP addresses, shlink now waits 1 minute before trying to resolve any more addresses.


## [1.10.1] - 2018-08-02
### Added
* *Nothing*

### Changed
* [#167](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/167) Shlink version is now set at build time to avoid older version numbers to be kept in newer builds.

### Deprecated

### Removed
* *Nothing*

### Fixed
* [#165](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/165) Fixed custom slugs failing when they are longer than 10 characters.
* [#166](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/166) Fixed unusual edge case in which visits were not properly counted when ordering by visit and filtering by search term in `[GET] /short-codes` API endpoint.
* [#174](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/174) Fixed geolocation not working due to a deprecation on used service.
* [#172](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/172) Documented missing filtering params for `[GET] /short-codes/{shortCode}/visits` API endpoint, which allow the list to be filtered by date range.

    For example: `https://s.test/rest/v1/short-urls/abc123/visits?startDate=2017-05-23&endDate=2017-10-05`

* [#169](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/169) Fixed unhandled error when parsing `ShortUrlMeta` and date fields are already `DateTime` instances.


## [1.10.0] - 2018-07-09
### Added
* [#161](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/161) AddED support for shlink to be run with [swoole](https://www.swoole.co.uk/) via [zend-expressive-swoole](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-swoole) package

### Changed
* [#159](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/159) Updated CHANGELOG to follow the [keep-a-changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) format
* [#160](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/160) Update infection to v0.9 and phpstan to v 0.10

## [1.9.1] - 2018-06-18
### Added
* [#155](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/155) Improved the pagination object returned in lists, including more meaningful properties.
    
    * Old structure:
    
    ```json
    {
      "pagination": {
        "currentPage": 1,
        "pagesCount": 2
      }
    }
    ```
    
    * New structure:
    
    ```json
    {
      "pagination": {
        "currentPage": 2,
        "pagesCount": 13,
        "itemsPerPage": 10,
        "itemsInCurrentPage": 10,
        "totalItems": 126
      }
    }
    ```

### Changed
* *Nothing*

### Deprecated

### Fixed
* [#154](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/154) Fixed sizes of every result page when filtering by searchTerm
* [#157](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/157) Background commands executed by installation process now respect the originally used php binary


## [1.9.0] - 2018-05-07
### Added
* [#147](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/147) Allowed short URLs to be created on the fly using a single API request, including the API key in a  query param.

    This eases integration with third party services.
    
    With this feature, a simple request to a URL like `https://s.test/rest/v1/short-codes/shorten?apiKey=[YOUR_API_KEY]&longUrl=[URL_TO_BE_SHORTENED]` would return the shortened one in JSON or plain text format.

### Changed
