<!--
Before opening an issue, just take into account that this is a completely free of charge open source project.
I'm always happy to help and provide support, but some understanding will be required.
I do this in my own free time, so expect some delays when implementing new features and fixing bugs, and don't take it personal if an issue gets eventually closed.
Try to be polite, and understand it is impossible for a project to cover all use cases.

With that said, please fill in the information requested next. More information might be requested next (like logs or system configs).
